## AI Brochure Maker (Streamlit)

Create a polished company brochure draft from a website. The app scrapes the site, filters for relevant pages (e.g., About, Careers), and uses an LLM (via OpenRouter) to produce a well-structured Markdown brochure.

---

### Impact
This project demonstrates the power of combining web scraping, intelligent link filtering, and Al-driven content generation to deliver ready-to-use marketing assets. It shows how businesses can reduce costs, speed up content creation, and maintain consistent messaging with minimal human input.

#### 1) Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2) Configure Secrets
Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your OpenRouter API key:
```toml
Openrouter_Api_Key="sk-or-..."
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

#### 3) Environment Variables
- OPENAI_API_KEY (optional; not required if using OpenRouter via secrets)

#### 4) Run Locally
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Open the printed local URL in your browser.

---

### Deployment
- Push this repository to GitHub
- On Streamlit Community Cloud, create a new app, point it to your repo, and set up `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with `Openrouter_Api_Key`
- Deploy. The app will use secrets in the cloud environment

---

### Notes
- Be sure the target site allows scraping and respect robots.txt and legal terms
- If few relevant links are found, try more specific subpages or different domains

### Example Workflow
- **Input:** `https://examplecompany.com`
- **Extracted:** About Us, Services, Careers pages
- **Output:** A company brochure summarizing mission, values, offerings, and opportunities.
